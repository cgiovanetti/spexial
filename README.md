`spexial` provides special functions for JAX, following the `scipy.special` API. The implementations are written in terms of JAX primitives, so they compose with `jit`, `grad` and `vmap`, and run on CPU, GPU and TPU.

It exists to fill gaps in `jax.scipy.special`, of three kinds:

- **Missing.** The modified Bessel `K` functions, the polylogarithm, the Gegenbauer polynomials, the normalized Legendre function, the unregularized incomplete beta and the Cartesian spherical harmonics have no JAX counterpart at any version.
- **Wrong, or narrower.** `zeta` returns `nan` for negative integers; `spence` rejects complex arguments; `sph_harm_y` pairs each degree with one angle instead of broadcasting, so array degrees give incorrect values.
- **Badly differentiated.** Where a closed form exists, the JVP is written out by hand instead of differentiating through the series. Sometimes that is faster (`incomplete_beta`, 143x), sometimes cheaper in memory (`polylog`, 268x less residual), and sometimes it is the difference between a number and `nan` — JAX's `spence` differentiates to `nan` across roughly 1 < x < 2, and its `sph_harm_y` at both poles.

Where SciPy already covers a case, `spexial` matches it rather than claiming to exceed it. [Coverage](https://jaxtronomy.github.io/spexial/reference/coverage/) records, per function, which gap it fills, and what upstream would have to do for the row to be deleted.

## Installation

```bash
pip install spexial
```

or

```bash
uv add spexial
```

## Example

```pycon
>>> import jax
>>> jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)

>>> import jax.numpy as jnp
>>> import spexial as sp

>>> # Gegenbauer polynomial C_n^alpha(x), matching scipy.special.eval_gegenbauer
>>> sp.eval_gegenbauer(3, 0.5, 0.25)
Array(-0.3359375, dtype=float64, weak_type=True)

```

Everything is vectorisable and differentiable in the usual way:

```pycon
>>> xs = jnp.linspace(-1.0, 1.0, 5)
>>> jax.vmap(lambda x: sp.eval_gegenbauer(3, 0.5, x))(xs)
Array([-1.    ,  0.4375, -0.    , -0.4375,  1.    ], dtype=float64)

```

## What is here

| Function | `scipy.special` counterpart |
| --- | --- |
| `comb` | `comb` (the `exact=False` variant) |
| `gamma` | `gamma` — JAX's value, plus an analytic derivative |
| `eval_gegenbauer` | `eval_gegenbauer` |
| `eval_gegenbauers` | -- returns every order up to `n` |
| `incomplete_beta` | -- the _unregularized_ `B(a, b, z)`; `betainc` is the regularized form |
| `k0`, `k1`, `k2` | `k0`, `k1`, `kn` |
| `k0e`, `k1e`, `k2e` | `k0e`, `k1e`, `kve` — scaled by `e^z`, no upper limit |
| `polylog` | -- the polylogarithm |
| `spence` | `spence` — complex too, which JAX rejects |
| `spherical_jn` | `spherical_jn` |
| `spherical_jn_all` | -- every order up to `n` |
| `sph_legendre_p` | `sph_legendre_p` — absent from JAX at any version |
| `sph_harm_y` | `sph_harm_y` — JAX's returns incorrect values for array degrees |
| `sph_harm_y_cart` | -- from a Cartesian direction; correct gradients on the z-axis |
| `sph_harm_y_cart_all` | `sph_harm_y_all` (layout only) — the whole `(l, m)` table in one pass |
| `sph_harm_y_cart_all_terms` | -- as above, returned as separate arrays so reductions stay fused |
| `zeta` | `zeta` — negative integers, which JAX gives as `nan` |

**Read [Accuracy and domains](https://jaxtronomy.github.io/spexial/reference/accuracy-and-domains/) before relying on any of these.** It records, per function, the domain each is tested over and the tolerance it actually meets. Some are not machine-precision — the modified Bessel functions are accurate to about `1e-7`, and `zeta` does not implement the critical strip.
